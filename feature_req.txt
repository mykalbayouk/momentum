## Feature Requests
- Have Multiple Groups
- When Clicking group code, it copies to clipboard
- Store Multiple Workouts ? (Maybe prenium Feature)

## Bug Fixes
- ✅ Default Strength Training to first exercise
- ✅ When Typing notes, keyboard blocks textbox from being seen
- ✅ Do not allow user to leave edit profile screen, if they have not saved changes
- ✅ Weely Goal going above 7 Days, form edit profile screen
- Ensure when new user joins app, updates for everyone


## Things I need to add
- Warning that if last member leaves group, group will be deleted
